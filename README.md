# 🕵️‍♂️ Best Proxy Scraper

A **fast, asynchronous, open-source** proxy scraper built in Python 3 — clean, powerful, and made for people who actually **know what they're doing**.

> 🚀 Built for devs, not skids.  
> If your only skill is re-uploading GitHub projects with a new name — this one isn’t for you.

- Fully asynchronous (uses `aiohttp`)
- Scrapes from multiple public sources
- Automatic deduplication  
- Simple CLI — no config hell

## 🔥 Anti-Skid Manifesto
Let’s keep it real:

> ❌  No “I decrypted this from Discord” nonsense  
> ❌  No “renamed and sold as premium version” scams  
> ❌  No base64-obfuscated malware pretending to be protection  
> ✅  100% clean, readable, and legally shareable Python

If you steal this and call it your own, congratulations —  
you’ve officially become the **definition of “skid”**.

Respect open source.  
Learn something instead of copy-pasting other people’s work.
